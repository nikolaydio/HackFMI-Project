HackFMI-Project
===============

A test system(like moodle) prototyped at HackFMI 2.0 (a local hackaton) based on django and python.

This was our first django app. We also realized we should not make any front-ends if we want the world to be a better place.


We had approx 2 days to prototype a solution that can help our education system in some way.

Participation was available for groups of 1 to 5 people. (We were 2)


P.S. Don't ask me what the name of our project mean - no idea(ask my teammate).
